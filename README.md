### Web Scraping and data processing in Python

Different data science project invariably begins with data collection. Among myriad of data sources, one of the 
source of the data is different websites. Some websites these days provide nice APIs to colect different types of data whereas most of them might be missing such APIs. In such case, web scraping is one of the most effective and simple ways to collect data of our interest.

This project shows such example of webscraping using Python.  
First, US presidential data is scraped from wikipedia and data is preprocessed using Pandas library. Finally, the data is loaded into mysql database running into docker container. 



```python
